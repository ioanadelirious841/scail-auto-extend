# SCAIL Auto Extend

A ComfyUI custom node that generates SCAIL-2 videos of any length in a single queue. It automatically splits generation into chunks (the model's limit is 81 frames), anchors each chunk on the last frames of the previous one, color-matches to prevent drift, and stitches the result — no manual extension sections, bypassing, or frame math.

## What it does

SCAIL-2 generates at most 81 frames per pass. Longer videos require extension passes where the first 5 frames are anchored to the last 5 frames of the previous chunk, so each extension only contributes 76 new frames — and the final chunk length depends on the input video. Doing this by hand means duplicated node sections, manual bypassing, and recalculating the last chunk for every video.

The **SCAIL Auto Extend Sampler** node does the whole loop internally at runtime:

1. Reads the pose video length (controlled as usual by your video loader's force_rate / skip / frame cap), trimmed to the nearest 4n+1 frames.
2. Plans the chunks: 81, then 81 (76 new + 5 overlap) repeating, with an automatically sized final chunk. E.g. 197 frames → 81 + 81 + 45.
3. For each chunk: builds the SCAIL-2 conditioning, samples, decodes, and (optionally) Reinhard-LAB color-matches the new frames to the last frame of the previous chunk.
4. Stitches everything and outputs the full image batch plus a frame count.

It calls ComfyUI's own `WanSCAILToVideo`, `SamplerCustom`, and `ColorTransfer` implementations internally, so output is identical to the equivalent hand-built chain.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI with the SCAIL-2 nodes ([currently requires PR #14373](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/pull/14373))
- SCAIL-2 models: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/SCAIL-2/tree/main/diffusion_models

The bundled example workflow additionally uses:

- [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) (video load/combine)
- [ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes) (resize, Set/Get, model loader)
- [ComfyUI-SAM3](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3) (person tracking for the colored masks)
- [ComfyUI_essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials) (GetImageSize+)

## Installation

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Brobert-in-aus/scail-auto-extend
```

Restart ComfyUI. The node appears as **SCAIL Auto Extend Sampler** (`sampling/video`).

## Usage

Load the included workflow: [`SCAIL Auto Extend.json`](https://github.com/Brobert-in-aus/scail-auto-extend/raw/main/SCAIL%20Auto%20Extend.json) (direct download — right-click → Save As, or drag the file into ComfyUI) — input video + reference image in, finished video out.

Or wire the node into your own workflow in place of your sampler section:

| Input | Connect from |
|---|---|
| model | your model chain (e.g. ModelSamplingSD3) |
| positive / negative | CLIPTextEncode |
| vae | VAELoader |
| sampler / sigmas | KSamplerSelect / BasicScheduler |
| pose_video | your (resized) driving video |
| pose_video_mask | SCAIL2ColoredMask → pose_video_mask |
| reference_image | reference image |
| reference_image_mask | SCAIL2ColoredMask → reference_image_mask |
| clip_vision_output | CLIPVisionEncode |
| width / height | generation resolution |

Outputs: `images` (stitched batch → VHS_VideoCombine) and `frame_count`.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| chunk_length | 81 | Max frames per chunk (model limit). Must be 4n+1. |
| overlap | 5 | Anchor frames carried between chunks. SCAIL-2 was trained at 5. |
| seed_mode | increment | `increment`: chunk i uses noise_seed + i. `fixed`: same seed every chunk. |
| color_transfer | true | Reinhard-LAB match of each chunk to the previous chunk's last frame (fights color drift). |
| pose_strength / pose_start / pose_end | 1.0 / 0.0 / 1.0 | Pose conditioning strength and active step range. |
| replacement_mode | true | SCAIL-2 replacement vs animation mode (must match your mask setup). |

### Notes

- Total length is driven by however many frames reach `pose_video` — cap or trim at your video loader. Input is trimmed to the nearest 4n+1 frames (loses at most 3).
- Progress is reported per chunk; the console logs the chunk plan, e.g. `[SCAIL Auto Extend] 197 pose frames -> 197 output frames, 3 chunk(s): [81, 81, 45]`.
- Interrupting cancels cleanly between/during chunks.
